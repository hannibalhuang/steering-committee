# ONNX Steering Commitee election guideline [DRAFT]

## Introduction

To encourage community participation and wider adoption in the industry, ONNX has introduced [open governance](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/wiki/Expanded-ONNX-Steering-Committee-Announced!) in March 2018. The governance has three defined structures to propel the development of ONNX project forward: [Steering Committee](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/tree/master/community#steering-committee), [Special Interest Groups (SIGs)](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/tree/master/community#sig---special-interest-groups), and [Working Groups (WGs)](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/tree/master/community#wg---working-groups). While SIGs and WGs primarily focus on the techinical roadmap of ONNX, the Steering Committe is responsible for setting the vision and governance process of the ONNX community. 

For the first year of its ONNX open governance, representitives from Facebook, Microsoft, AWS, Intel and Nvidia are chosen to serve as the ONNX Steering Committee to help guide the project. The Steering Committee will be elected by the [Contributors](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/tree/master/community#community-roles) in its second year and will be re-elected every year. 

This document is created to provide guidelines for the election process to ensure maximum transparency and fairness.

To participate in the Steering commitee election, you must be a Contributor to the ONNX project. As defined in the community guideline, Contributor is sponsored by 2 approvers from different companies.

## Candidacy process

## Voting process 

### General election procedure
In order to promote fairness, the Steering Committee has decided to limit 1 vote per Member Company. Contributors will be able to vote individually, but their votes will be rolled up to represent the vote of associated Member Company. This procedure will prevent large companies with lots of Contributors from dominating the election results. 

### Voting mechanics and algorithm

The election will use [Condorcet ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) with [Schulze method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method). Condorcet ranking allows voters to indicate ranked preference for candidates, and Schultz method provides an algorithm to tally the overall preference.

For ONNX Steering Committee election, the Condorcet ranking with Schulze method will be performed twice. The individual Contributor votes gets tallied first to Member Companies, and the results of the Member Company votes are ranked again using the same method. 

### Voting platform
We will use Condorcet Internet Voting Service ([civs.cs.cornell.edu](https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/)) to collect votes from Contributors. 

After votes are casted, the results of individual votes will be uploaded to ONNX Github election directory to ensure transparency. 

<code>**[TODO]** Determine if we can use other platforms</code> 

## Election officers and Steering Committee emeritus members

### Election officers
Two election officers will be chosen from the current Steering committee to oversee the election process. 
<code>**[TODO]** Confirm with Steering Committee </code> 

### Steering Committee emeritus members
Two Steering Committee members will remain as emeritus members for the newly elected Committee to help with transition process for 1 month. 
<code>**[TODO]** Confirm with Steering Committee </code>
